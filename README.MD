# Python and React: MyUni Education Sample Application

### Github repo: MyUniSampleApp

## Introduction
MyUni is a DocuSign sample application written in Python 3.7 (server) and React (client). You can find a live instance running at [https://myuni.sampleapps.docusign.com/](https://myuni.sampleapps.docusign.com/).
 
MyUni demonstrates the following:

1. Authentication with DocuSign via [JSON Web Token (JWT) Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/jwt/).
2. **Change Your Major or Minor:** ([Source](./app/api/requests.py))  
   This example uses the DocuSign [eSignature REST API](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api) to send an envelope based on an HTML template with prefilled user data and then initiate an embedded signing ceremony for a single signer. [AutoPlace](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/tabs/auto-place/) (anchor text) is used to position the signing fields in the documents.
3. **Request an Unofficial Transcript:** ([Source](./app/api/clickwrap.py))  
   This example demonstates the DocuSign [Click API](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/click-api/). Once the user submits the form, the app uses a clickwrap to present a modal dialog requesting confirmation before allowing the user to download an unofficial transcript.

4. **Sign Up for Extracurricular Activities:** ([Source](./app/api/requests.py))  
   This example uses the DocuSign [eSignature REST API](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api), demonstrating how to use envelopes combined with payment gateways. The example sends an envelope based on HTML template and adds payment feature to the document, so after signing, the user will be able to pay for their chosen activity.  
   To use this example, create a test payments gateway for your developer account.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* A DocuSign developer account. Create a [free account](https://go.docusign.com/sandbox/productshot/?elqCampaignId=16535).
* A DocuSign integration key (a client ID) that is configured to use JSON Web Token (JWT) Grant.
   You will need the **integration key** itself and its **RSA key pair**. To use this application, you must add your application's **Redirect URI** to your integration key. This [**video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgDqa7-L0yo) demonstrates how to create an integration key (client ID) for a user application like this example. 
* [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#module-venv)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+

### Required environment variables

* **DS_CLIENT_ID** - The integration key is the same as the client ID
* **DS_CLIENT_SECRET** - Integration Secret Key
* **DS_IMPERSONATED_USER_GUID** - API account ID
* **DS_TARGET_ACCOUNT_ID** - Target account ID. Use FALSE to indicate the user's default
* **DS_PAYMENT_GATEWAY_ID** - Payment gateway ID (Only Stripe method supported)
* **DS_PAYMENT_GATEWAY_NAME** - Payment gateway name
* **DS_PAYMENT_GATEWAY_DISPLAY_NAME** - Payment gateway display name
* **DS_PRIVATE_KEY** - Private key string, source or path; for instance: /app/id_rsa
* **REACT_APP_DS_RETURN_URL** - URL where the back end of the application is located (If you run it locally, use `http://localhost:3000`)
* **REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL** - URL where the front end of the application is located; will be used by Docusign to redirect back after signing ceremony (If you run it locally, use `http://localhost:5001/api`)
* **DS_AUTH_SERVER** - The DocuSign authentication server (for testing purposes, use `https://account-d.docusign.com`)
* **REACT_APP_DS_DEMO_SERVER** - Link to the DocuSign demo server (for testing purposes, use `https://demo.docusign.net`)
* **REACT_APP_DS_CLICKWRAP_URL** - Link to the hosted clickwrap client (for testing purposes, use `//demo.docusign.net/clickapi/sdk/latest/docusign-click.js`)

3. Install python packages **`pip install -r requirements.txt`**
4. Install React dependencies using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) package manager  **npm install**
5. Update the **.env** file with the integration key and other settings.  
     > **Note:** Protect your integration key and client secret. You should make sure that your **.env** file will not be stored in your source code repository.
6. Navigate to [the admin demo Apps and Keys page](https://admindemo.docusign.com/authenticate?goTo=appsAndKeys), add the Redirect URI http://localhost:3000/callback and then hit save

**Using installation scripts**

1. Download or clone this repository to your workstation in the folder **sample-app-myuni-python**.
2. Navigate to the scripts subfolder: **`cd sample-app-myuni-python/scripts`**
3. Run the installation script: **`./install.sh`**
4. Update the **.env** file with the integration key and other settings.  
    > **Note:** Protect your integration key and client secret. You should make sure that your **.env** file will not be stored in your source code repository.
5. Navigate to [the admin demo Apps and Keys page](https://admindemo.docusign.com/authenticate?goTo=appsAndKeys), add the Redirect URI http://localhost:3000/callback and then hit save

### Additional installation scripts
All installation scripts are located in the **scripts** folder.

1. To remove the virtual environment and modules, run **`./clean.sh`**
   
## Running MyUni

### Manual

1. Navigate to the application folder: **`cd sample-app-myuni-python`**
2. Run the application: **`flask run --port 5001`**
3. Run npm: **`npm start`**
4. Open a browser to **http://localhost:3000**

### Using installation scripts

All installation scripts are located in the **scripts** folder.
1. Navigate to the scripts subfolder: **`cd scripts`**
2. Run the application script: **`./run.sh`**

## Configuring a DocuSign payments gateway

DocuSign offers built-in connections to multiple payment gateways. The payments example in this sample app uses a demo account for the Stripe gateway service.

### Creating the payments gateway account

1. Log in to your [developer account](https://appdemo.docusign.com/) and select Admin.
2. On the Integrations/Payments screen, click Stripe.
3. For development, you can skip the Stripe account application by using the `Skip this account form` on the top of the page.  
  The Admin Panel will show that an enabled Stripe payment gateway account has been associated with your DocuSign developer account.
5. Configure the example launcher with the gateway account ID shown in the Admin panel.
6. Add the payment gateway account ID to the **.env** file.
